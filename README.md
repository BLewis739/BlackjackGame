# BlackjackGame

This project is a blackjack game written in Python to be played in the console.

The player starts with a bank of $1000, and can choose the size of their bet for each hand.

The game currently supports hit, stand, blackjack, and double down. I am working to incorporate insurance and split as options.

The program is an extension of a project from Boston University's CS111 course with Professor David Sullivan. 

In the course, the classes for card.py and hand.py are written as part of a problem set about inheritance in object oriented programming.

The gameplay is an original design and was written as a challenge for 11-12th grade students in a high school Python programming course.
